CycleGAN is an image-to-image translation algorithm in the domain of Generative AI. It works by learning the mapping between two different image domains, such as photographs and sketches, using unpaired dataset.

Here, a CycleGAN have been developed from scratch for image-to-image translation of horses to zebras and vice versa.

Some example of one domain (horse images) can be seen on the upper row, while some images of the other domain is shown in the lower row. A sample output after a try to train the model is as follow:
